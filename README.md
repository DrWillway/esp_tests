# ESP32 Tests for ISEP University

This project contains test implementations using the ESP32 microcontroller for educational purposes as part of a class at **ISEP**.

## Overview

The tests involve setting up an asynchronous web server using the **ESPAsyncWebServer** library along with **AsyncTCP**. These tests explore the following:
- Setting up the ESP32 as a Wi-Fi access point.
- Controlling GPIO pins via HTTP requests using a JSON-based API.
- Handling multiple client connections in a non-blocking manner.

## Libraries Used
- **ESPAsyncWebServer**
- **AsyncTCP**
- **ArduinoJson**

## Purpose

These experiments were conducted as part of coursework to better understand the capabilities of the ESP32 in handling web servers and network communication.
